## Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)

* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* You must use [get](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get) to access to dictionary value by key (it won’t throw an exception if the key doesn’t exist in the dictionary)
* Your code should not be executed when imported (by using if __name__ == "__main__":)

**Note:**
