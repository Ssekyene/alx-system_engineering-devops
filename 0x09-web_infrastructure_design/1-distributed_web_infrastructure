## Must have
* 2 servers
* 1 web server (Nginx)
* 1 application server
* 1 application server
* 1 load-balancer (HAproxy)
* 1 set of application files (code base)
* 1 database (MySQL)

## Questions

* Why did we add each additional element?
    2 web servers: avoid downtime, SPOF, and provide redundancy
    load balancer: distribute incoming requets
* What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works?
    round robin  or static round robin or source?
* Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup? Explain the difference.
 active-active is when both running at the same time equally distributing info
 active-passive only one at a time and the other goes on line when needed
* How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works?
    There's only one master and one or more slaves. Master can read and write and slave can only read and replicate data.
* What is the difference between the primary node and the Replica node in regards to the applicationThe app mainly uses the primary node for read and write. Retrival can be from both nodes. The replica nodes help distribute the read load and provide redundancy for data retrieval.


## What are the issues with this infrastructure?

* Where are SPOF?
    the load balancer
* Security isses? (no firewall, no HTTPS)
    no firewalls and https so user data is not safe
* no monitoring?
    monitoring catches possible errors or problems
