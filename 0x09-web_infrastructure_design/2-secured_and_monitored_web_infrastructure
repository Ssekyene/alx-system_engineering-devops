 Design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored

## Must have
* 3 firewalls
* 1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS
* 3 monitoring clients(data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services)

## Questions

* Why did we add each additional element?
    3 firewalls: enhance infrastructure security.
    1 SSL Certificate: encrypt data in transit, provide secure connection between web server and client.
    3 monitoring clients: gather data on infrastructure's performance, health and resource utilizaion
* What are firewalls for?
    prevent unauthorized access, potential attacks and protect sensitive data
* Why is the traffic served over HTTPS?
    To protect user data
* What is monitoring used for?
    track the performance, health and status of the infrastructure components.
* How does the monitoring tool collect data?
    through the monitoring clients installed on each server.

* Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS?
    configure the monitoring client to track incoming requests and record the total number of queries per second.

## What are the issues with this infrastructure?

* Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue?
	Terminating SSL at the load balancer means that the load balancer decrypts the incoming HTTPS traffic before distributing it to the web servers. 

* Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue?
	It creates a single point of failure. If this server fails, write operations will be unavailable, and the application might not function correctly.

* Why having servers with all the same components (database, webserver and application server) might be a problem?
	Having identical server components might be a problem if all servers experience the same vulnerabilities or issues simultaneously.
