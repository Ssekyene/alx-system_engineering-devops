# 0x0F. Load balancer
## Background Context
You have been given 2 additional servers:

+ gc-[STUDENT_ID]-web-02-XXXXXXXXXX
+ gc-[STUDENT_ID]-lb-01-XXXXXXXXXX

Let’s improve our web stack so that there is [redundancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_%28engineering%29) for our web servers. This will allow us to be able to accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers, and to make our infrastructure more reliable. If one web server fails, we will still have a second one to handle requests.

For this project, you will need to write Bash scripts to automate your work. All scripts must be designed to configure a brand new Ubuntu server to match the task requirements.

## Tasks
>
- [0-custom_http_response_header](./0-custom_http_response_header)

In this first task you need to configure `web-02` to be identical to `web-01`. Fortunately, you built a Bash script during your web server project, and they’ll now come in handy to easily configure web-02. Remember, always try to automate your work!

Since we’re placing our web servers behind a load balancer for this project, we want to add a custom Nginx response header. The goal here is to be able to track which web server is answering our HTTP requests, to understand and track the way a load balancer works. More in the coming tasks.

Example:
```
sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI 34.198.248.145 | grep X-Served-By
X-Served-By: 03-web-01
sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI 54.89.38.100 | grep X-Served-By
X-Served-By: 03-web-02
sylvain@ubuntu$
```
If your server’s hostnames are not properly configured `([STUDENT_ID]-web-01` and `[STUDENT_ID]-web-02.)`, follow this [tutorial](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/linux-static-hostname).
>
- [1-install_load_balancer](./1-install_load_balancer)

Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server.

Example:
```
sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -Is 54.210.47.110
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)

- [2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp](./2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp)

Just as in task #0, we’d like you to automate the task of creating a custom HTTP header response, but with Puppet.
